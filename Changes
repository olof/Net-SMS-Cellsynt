Changes in Net::SMS::Cellsynt

0.32 Released: 2015-01-18

* Fix issue with empty bodies in responses. This includes a bump
  of required WWW::Curl::Easy version to 4.14. (Reported by
  plundra.)
* Don't create a new WWW::Curl::Easy object for each sms, reuse
  the on created in the constructor. (Reported by plundra.)
* Correctly report the reference ID from Cellsynt. Because of
  a bug, the reference id was not available via the "id" key, as
  specified in the documentation, but via the "uri" key. This is
  now corrected, but for backwards compatibility, the uri will
  work as well. This backwards compatibility change will be
  removed in a future version. (Reported by plundra.)
* Correctly report errors from the gateway provider. Because of
  a bug, the error text was not available via the "message"
  key, as specified in the documentation, but via the "uri" key.
  This is now corrected, but for backwards compatibility, the uri
  will work as well. This backwards compatibility change will be
  removed in a future version.

0.31 Released: 2011-05-24
Oops, the 0.3 release was kinda hastey. The documentation contained
a real password (changed now :-)) and this changelog was not really
totally updated.

 Documentation 
 * Removed a former real password in doc script
 * Updated old changelog item (correct release date, correct version)

0.3  Released: 2011-05-24
 API
 * API breakage (sorry)
   - Return values from send_sms() are hashrefs with status, see POD
 * Use URI.pm instead of ugly concatenation of query params.
 Documentation
 * Found out that I didn't have a changelog! Now I have. (2011-02-24) 
 * Change of e-mail address. From zibri to olof@cpan.org (2011-02-24) 
 * Documented availability (CPAN, Github) in POD and README (2011-02-24) 
 * The GPL-2 text in LICENSE was replaced with GPL-1. (2011-02-24)

   Note that this isn't a change in what license the module is relased
   under. It is, and has always been, Artistic License or GPL-1 or later.
