Changes in Net::SMS::Cellsynt

0.21 Released: 2011-05-20
 API
 * API breakage (sorry)
   - Return values from send_sms() are hashrefs with status, see POD
 * Use URI.pm instead of ugly concatenation of query params.
 Documentation
 * Found out that I didn't have a changelog! Now I have. (2011-02-24) 
 * Change of e-mail address. From zibri to olof@cpan.org (2011-02-24) 
 * Documented availability (CPAN, Github) in POD and README (2011-02-24) 
 * The GPL-2 text in LICENSE was replaced with GPL-1. (2011-02-24)

   Note that this isn't a change in what license the module is relased
   under. It is, and has always been, Artistic License or GPL-1 or later.
